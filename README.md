# Air_BNB
Dataset: airbnb listing and review: https://www.kaggle.com/mysarahmadbhat/airbnb-listings-reviews

I analysed the dataset of air bnb during my studies of business data analysis. I mostly used Qlik sense especially for the graphs but also Python and excel to calculate some fields. 

With python I did some machine learning to evaluate the importance of the amenities in the rating score.
